# Create .test. file

**Create .test. file** is a VS Code extension that helps you create unit test files effortlessly. Simply right-click on any `.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx` or `.tsx` file in the Explorer, and select "Create .test. file" from the context menu. A matching `.test.` file will be generated in the same directory, ready for you to write those all-important tests. No more excuses for not testing your code — your test files are just a click away!

P.S. This is my first venture into building an extension, so if you notice anything off, don’t hesitate to [file an issue](https://github.com/ltclmbdev/vscode-create-test-files/issues) 🙌
